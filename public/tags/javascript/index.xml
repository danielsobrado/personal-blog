      <description>Introduction All started when I started developping some quick reconcialition tool for the bankÂ´s Product Control team, someone said: &amp;ldquo;Hey Daniel, can you help us with this? Take this and that and apply this rules and give us the results on something we can visualize, it is too much data for excel!
