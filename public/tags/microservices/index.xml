      <description>Introduction Microservices are based on the principle &amp;ldquo;divide and conquer&amp;rdquo;.
There is a trade-off between having too many services and too few or only one, and this depends on the scope of your project.
Add extra services provide some advantages but there are also disadvantages, having too many services is extreme, having only one service (Monolith pattern) is also extreme (Nano-services antipattern), the right balance is where we want to be.</description>
