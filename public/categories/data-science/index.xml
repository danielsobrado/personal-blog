      <description> So many new concepts for the beginner data scentist, let´s start one by one:
Tensor A tensor is a generalized matrix, it is defined by his rank, a rank zero tensor, is just a number, while a rank two tensor is a two dimensional matrix or array.
See: What’s the difference between a matrix and a tensor?

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>
