      <description>Introduction Microservices are based on the principle &amp;ldquo;divide and conquer&amp;rdquo;.
There is a trade-off between having too many services and too few or only one, and this depends on the scope of your project.

      <description>Introduction All started when I started developing some quick reconciliation tool for the bankÂ´s Product Control team, someone said: &amp;ldquo;Hey Daniel, can you help us with this? Take this and that and apply this rules and give us the results on something we can visualize, it is too much data for excel!
I love solving issues for my business partners and I immediately started rolling my sleeves, things look simple and easy at the beginning but the reality sometimes is different, I had a to use a large database to transform the data, this triggered a proper project and many governance procedures, like authentication, authorization, Chinese walls, user management etc.</description>
