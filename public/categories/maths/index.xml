      <description>Introduction to Linear Regression  A linear regression tries to estimate a linear relationship that best fits a given set of data.
 We need to understand that Linear Regression won´t help us with non linear relationships.
$$ y_i = h(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x}_i $$ $$ L(\mathbf{w}) = \sum_i \left(h(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{w}) - y_i\right)^2 $$ $$ L(\mathbf{w}) $$ Concepts:
Simple linear regression: Is a linear model using a single predictor variable.</description>

      <description>Move static content to static asdsdswd Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>Introduction Let´s suppose that we know all the possible causes for an outcome, for example:
**
Bayes theorem Posterior = ( Likelihood * Prior ) / Evidence
Here, P(movie|Sci-fi) is called Posterior, P(Sci-fi|Movie) is Likelihood, P(movie) is Prior, P(Sci-fi) is Evidence.
Prior: How probable was our hypothesis before observing the evidence? Posterior: How probable is our hypothesis given the observed evidence? Evidence: How probable is the new evidence under all possible hypotheses?</description>

      <description>Introduction In this series of articles, We&amp;rsquo;ll dig deep into understanding Bayesian inference, starting from the basics.
The main idea behind Bayesian statistics is the Bayes theorem, we need to understand some concepts first.
TL;DR Let´s take the following poker cards as an example:
Our experiment is to take two cards for the deck, one at a time, each card extraction is an event. We define as outcomes that a card is of a defined</description>
