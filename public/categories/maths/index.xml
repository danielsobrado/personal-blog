      <description>Move static content to static asdsdswd Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

Concepts Let´s illustrate these concepts with poker cards and rolling dices:
 A probability is a number between 0 and 1, both included, that describes the degree of confidence that we have in a prediction, 0 is none or false and 1 is all or true.</description>
