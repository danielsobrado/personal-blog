## Introduction

All started when I started developping some quick reconcialition tool for the bank´s Product Control team, someone said: "*Hey Daniel, can you help us with this? Take this and that and apply this rules and give us the results on something we can visualize, it is too much data for excel!*

I love solving issues for my business partners and I immediately started rolling my sleaves, things look simple and easy at the begining but the reality sometimes is different, I had a to use a large database to transform the data, this triggered a proper project and many gobernance procedures, like authentication, authorization, chinese walls, user management etc.

I had the need to build a front end where the users can login, and I was building all in-house, sometimes the quickest solution is the one you can build yourself without vendors, support SLAs etc... This was one of these situations, but.. 

I haven´t touched any front-end from ages, hiring a Java script developer looked overkill, so I took one of these nice looking open source single page administration pages that are nowadays so common.

This was built in AngularJS so I decided that it was a good opportunity to get some skills, anyway I "*only*" had to write some controllers on top of the main prject, right?
