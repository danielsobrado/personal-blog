# Introduction

LetÂ´s suppose that we know all the possible causes for an outcome, for example:

**

# Bayes theorem

Posterior = ( Likelihood * Prior ) /  Evidence

Here, P(movie|Sci-fi) is called Posterior,
P(Sci-fi|Movie) is Likelihood,
P(movie) is Prior,
P(Sci-fi) is Evidence. 

Prior: How probable was our hypothesis before observing the evidence?
Posterior: How probable is our hypothesis given the observed evidence?
Evidence: How probable is the new evidence under all possible hypotheses?
Likelihood: How probable is the evidence give that our hypotheses is true?

We'll be using the following python packages:
