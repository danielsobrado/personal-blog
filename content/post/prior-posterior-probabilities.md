# Introduction

LetÂ´s suppose that we know all the possible causes for an outcome, for example:

**

# Bayes theorem

Posterior = ( Likelihood * Prior ) /  Evidence

<div id="el"><span>$$P ( A | B ) = \frac { P ( B | A ) P ( A ) } { P ( B ) }$$</span></div>

# Next 

We'll be using the following python packages:
* [pymc3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3) 
* [pyro](https://github.com/uber/pyro)
