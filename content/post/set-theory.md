A set is a collection of stuff, items, things... We'll call them *elements*.

We can have a set called **A**  that contains some numbers $ A \=\ {1,2,3,9\} $ and a set called **B** than contains names $ A \=\ {Daniel, Alfredo, Vikas, Praveen\} $ .

We can say that an element is part of a set: $ 3 \in A $


$$
\{ 2 \in A
$$
