## Introduction

Numpy is the fundation of scientific computing in Python.

## Installing Numpy

There are a few concepts that you need to understand before creating a theme.

## Numpy Arrays

ndarray is the earth of NumPy, it's the main data storage object of the framework.

### Why do we need other arrays?

We have Python lists and dictionaries, 

We can use the %timeit magic command in IPython to test the performance

#### ndarrays are fast!

#### Creating ndarrays

#### Slice and dice

#### Vectorization

Vectorization is where you apply a calculation on a Numpy Array without having to use a loop.

For example, if we have a Numpy array, we can multiply it by a number, each individual number will be multiplied withut having to write a for loop:

#### Broadcasting

## Maths

### Linear Algrebra

#### The matrix object

Hey! we have ndarray, we also need a matrix object?

### Statistics

## Reading and writing
