# Introduction to Linear Regression

> A linear regression tries to estimate a linear relationship that best fits a given set of data.

We need to understand that Linear Regression wonÂ´t help us with non linear relationships.

<div id="el"><span>$$ y_i = h(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x}_i $$</span></div>

<div id="el"><span>$$ L(\mathbf{w}) = \sum_i \left(h(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{w}) - y_i\right)^2 $$</span></div>

<div id="el"><span>$$ L(\mathbf{w}) $$</span></div>

Concepts:

Simple linear regression: Is a linear model using a single predictor variable.
