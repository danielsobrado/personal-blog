# Introduction

In Bayesian statistics there are two important concepts, we use probabilities to measure the uncertainty about the parameters used by the probability distributions, and we use the BayesÂ´ theorem to update those probabilities.  

# Naive Bayes

## Types of Naive Bayes Algorithms

### Gaussian Naive Bayes

We assume that each class has continuous Normal/Gaussian distributed values.

<div id="el"><span>$$ P \left( x _ { i } | y \right) = \frac { 1 } { \sqrt { 2 \pi \sigma _ { y } ^ { 2 } } } \exp \left( - \frac { \left( x _ { i } - \mu _ { y } \right) ^ { 2 } } { 2 \sigma _ { y } ^ { 2 } } \right) $$</span></div>
