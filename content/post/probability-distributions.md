# Introduction

Distributions a laws governing these are a must know for every data scientist.

# The law of large numbers

The law of large numbers states that the more samples we collect the more close the sample mean will be to the population mean.

# Central Limit Theorem

>  The sampling distribution of the mean of any independent, random variable will be normal or nearly normal, if the sample size is large enough.

We can say that 30 samples is a size good enough to consider it large enough, this theorem tells us that if we collect **random** samples from any distribution we'll finish with a Normal distribution in our sample dataset.

The underlying distribution needs to have always a defined mean for the Central Limit Theorem to be valid.

# Normal

# Binomial

# Bernoulli

# Poisson
