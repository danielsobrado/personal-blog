description: "Arguably the most famous machine learning low-level frameworks. Pytorch created by Facebook and used as the foundation in projects like Uber's pyro and Tensorflow created by Google and widely used. Both frameworks are used by the research community and for advanced models that are not readily available in high-level libraries like Keras."

# Introduction 

conda install statsmodels seaborn

# Plotting residuals

# Regression assumptions

Linearity and equal variance
Normality

# Interpreting residuals

# Common issues

# Heteroscedasticity 

## Identify heteroscedasticity

### Breusch-Pagan Lagrange Multiplier test

Using StatsModels we have `statsmodels.stats.diagnostic.het_breuschpagan`

# Non-linearity

## Outliers

## Long Y-axis datapoints

## X-axis unbalanced
