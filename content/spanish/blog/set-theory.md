## Basic concepts
A set is a collection of stuff, items, things... We'll call them *elements*.

We can have a set called **A**  that contains some numbers $ A \=\ {1,2,3,9\} $ and a set called **B** than contains names $ A \=\ {Daniel, Alfredo, Vikas, Praveen, Bjorn\} $ .

We can say that an element is part of a set: $ 3 \in A $
We can also say that 5 is not an element of A:  $ 5 \notinA $

We'll call cardinality to the number of elements in the set. In these cases $ | A | = 4 $ and $ | B | = 5 $

### Properties of the sets
The order is not important and listing an element more than once doesn't change the set.

### The empty set

## Interception

## Union
The cardinality of the union of two sets:
