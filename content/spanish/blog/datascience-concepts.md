So many new concepts for the beginner data scientist, let´s start one by one:

# Tensor

A tensor is a generalized matrix, it is defined by his rank, a rank zero tensor, is just a number, while a rank two tensor is a two dimensional matrix or array.

See: [What’s the difference between a matrix and a tensor?](https://medium.com/@quantumsteinke/whats-the-difference-between-a-matrix-and-a-tensor-4505fbdc576c)

# Features

# Data Splits

* **Training set**: This is the biggest set where we run our learning algorithm on.
* **Development set**: Also called **Hold-out set**, we use this set to tune hyper-parameter, select features etc.
* **Test set**: We evaluate the final performance of our algorithm with this set, we don´t re-use it, if we realized that we need to validate again against the test set, we should collect more data. 

# Terms for Simple Linear Regression

* Response, dependent variable, Y-variable, target, outcome: This is the variable we are trying to predict.
* Independent variable

# Regression vs Classification

# Supervised, non-supervised and reinforcement
