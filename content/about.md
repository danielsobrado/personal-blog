Having a curious nature, growth mindset, and self-starter attitude, I wear many hats and maintain my involvement in virtually every facet of the project lifecycle.

Some days, I'm a big data engineer, onboarding new data sources and/or architecting our technology stack. 

Some other days I'm a data scientist, conducting exploratory analyses or modeling machine learning solutions. 

Though, some days, I am more of a management specialist and strategist, working with business leaders to make data-driven decisions. 

Most days, I blend all of the above. 

I prefer to view myself as a problem solver, where code and data are my tools, and business results are my guidance.
