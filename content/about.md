On the professional side, I've been working in the banking industry for a long time, in banks like UBS, BNP, JP Morgan, Mitsubitsi/Morgan Stanley, National Bank of Abu Dhabi, in locations like New York, Tokyo, London, Madrid, and Abu Dhabi. I wear many hats and maintain my involvement in virtually every facet of the project lifecycle.

Some days, I'm a big data engineer, onboarding new data sources and/or architecting our technology stack. 

Some other days I'm a data scientist, conducting exploratory analyses or modeling machine learning solutions. 

Though, some days, I am more of a management specialist and strategist, working with business leaders to make data-driven decisions. 

Most days, I blend all of the above. 

I'm using this site as a means of self-development, they say that you never completely understand a subject until you are able to explain it. I think that everyone has a different angle, a view on something that’s worth sharing. 

I write about topics I want to refresh, subjects I'm studying and materials I want to learn, feel free to leave any comments. Because if it’s actually not good enough, I would like to know that, I want to be challenged to be able to advance further. 

Though, if you like it, and it gets popular I will support it and continue writing more about it.
