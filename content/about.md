Hi!, I´m Daniel, originally from northern Spain and currently residing in Abu Dhabi.

I enjoy traveling. Each and every time, I find something magical about having a new stamp on my passport. Apart from experiencing the beauty of a new place, I enjoy the experience wherein I get to meet new people, learn about their culture and traditions, and thus expand my level of awareness to level higher. 

Learning through travel changes you. It’s like you unravel and completely emerge to a different person. During my trips, I have learned how to appreciate people around me, irrespective of their position in the society, and their culture. Through immersion, I have earned their respect in return.

Naturally curious about how any new technology works and why, I enjoy spending time trying programming languages, tools, and frameworks. 

Join me on my journey in my search for new tools, frameworks,  and datasets. Together let us explore and broaden our horizon in the world of continuous learning. Together let us find the answers to questions we have been all seeking about. 

I have been working in the banking industry for a quite some time, in banks like UBS, BNP, JP Morgan, Mitsubishi/Morgan Stanley, National Bank of Abu Dhabi, and several locations around the globe like New York, Tokyo, London, Madrid, and Abu Dhabi. I wear many hats and maintain my involvement in virtually every facet of the project lifecycle.

Some days, I'm a big data engineer, onboarding new data sources and/or architecting our technology stack. 

Some other days I'm a data scientist, conducting exploratory analyses or modeling machine learning solutions. 

Though, some days, I am more of a management specialist and strategist, working with business leaders to make data-driven decisions. 

Most days, I blend all of the above.

I'm using this site as a tool of self-development, they say that you never completely understand a subject until you are able to explain it. I think that each one may view things at different angles. A view that may be contrasting but is something that’s worth sharing.

I write about topics I want to refresh, subjects I'm studying and materials I want to learn, feel free to leave any comments. Because if it’s actually not good enough, I would like to know that, I want to be challenged to be able to advance further. 

Though, if you like it, and it gets popular I will support it and continue writing more about it.

Let’s stay in touch! You can follow me, here on the following social media platforms:
