#### Random variables

#### Random processes

#### Introduction to Markov Processes

These are discrete processes where the events are are influenced from the immediate past, by a probability distribution.

An Event is a function of the past plus some noise.

It is known as "Markov property", that the probably of an event happening in a discrete stochastic process depends only on the previous event.

#### Introduction to Markov Chains

#### Properties of Markov Chains

Let's discuss the multiple properties of Markov Chains:

##### Reducibility

A Markov chain is said to be irreducibleÂ if we can reach any state of the given Markov chain from any other state.

##### Periodicity

A Markov chain is called aperiodic if all of its states are aperiodic. One major thing to note is that, in the case of an irreducible Markov chain, a single aperiodic state is enough to imply that all the states are aperiodic

##### Transience

##### Recurrence

##### Ergodicity

##### Steady-state Analysis

##### Limiting Distributions
