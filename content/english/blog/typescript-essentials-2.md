We discussed what is Typescript and how to install it in the previous post, let's understand the basics, now!

### Types

The main difference between Typescript and Javascript, is that typescript uses strict types.

In typescript we don't differentiate between integers an floats, we just have numbers:

``` let a: number = '6'; ``` 

We don't need to define the type of the variable, it can be inferred:

``` let a = '6'; ``` 

We cannot modify the type after like in Javascript.

### Objects and Arrays
