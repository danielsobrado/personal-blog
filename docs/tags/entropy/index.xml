      <description>Information theory A bit is a number that is equal to 0 or 1. In Information theory, receiving a bit reduces our uncertainty by half, or a factor of 2.
If our clients in the bank are likely to repay a loan or not, and we have our risk manager to tell us if a certain client repaid or not his loan, if the chance of the client being good or bad is 50%, our risk manager is reducing our uncertainty about the client by a factor of 2.</description>
