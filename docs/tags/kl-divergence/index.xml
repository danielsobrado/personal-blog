      <description>Cross-Entropy I our last post we&amp;rsquo;ve seen that entropy tells us the minimum number of bits that we need to encode our ground truth distribution.
 We cannot encode our correct distribution with less information than the entropy.
 What if we don&amp;rsquo;t know the correct or ground truth distribution? In real life we have a approximated view of the reality, we cannot observe all events in most cases.</description>

      <description>Information theory A bit is a number that is equal to 0 or 1. In Information theory, receiving a bit reduces our uncertainty by half, or a factor of 2.
If our clients in the bank are likely to repay a loan or not, and we have our risk manager to tell us if a certain client repaid or not his loan, if the chance of the client being good or bad is 50%, our risk manager is reducing our uncertainty about the client by a factor of 2.</description>
