      <description>Introduction Numpy is the core package for scientific computing, it has capabilities for fast processing of n-dimensional arrays and in general linear algebra.
There are multiple other well known packages in data science that rely on Numpy like Pandas and Scipy.
Installing Numpy For the examples we´ll just use pip to install Numpy, ideally it will be inside a container like Anaconda:
$ pip install numpy  Numpy Arrays ndarray is the earth of NumPy, it&amp;rsquo;s the main data storage object of the framework.</description>

      <title>Let&#39;s discuss Microservices</title>

      <description>Introduction Microservices are based on the principle &amp;ldquo;divide and conquer&amp;rdquo;.
There is a trade-off between having too many services and too few or only one, and this depends on the scope of your project.
Add extra services provide some advantages but there are also disadvantages, having too many services is extreme, having only one service (Monolith pattern) is also extreme (Nano-services antipattern), the right balance is where we want to be.</description>

      <description>Introduction All started when I started developing some quick reconciliation tool for the bank´s Product Control team, someone said: &amp;ldquo;Hey Daniel, can you help us with this? Take this and that and apply this rules and give us the results on something we can visualize, it is too much data for excel!
I love solving issues for my business partners and I immediately started rolling my sleeves, things look simple and easy at the beginning but the reality sometimes is different, I had a to use a large database to transform the data, this triggered a proper project and many governance procedures, like authentication, authorization, Chinese walls, user management etc.</description>

      <description>Machine Data Platforms There are two known platforms for machine data, Splunk and Elastic Stack, let&amp;rsquo;s do some research&amp;hellip;
The cost of the platforms Splunk is great but the price tag is not that great, Elastic Stack is Open Source but some of the Enterprise features and Advanced Analytics capabilities are licensed on X-Pack under a paywall, can we get around some of these capabilities, like security using other Open Source solutions?</description>

      <description>What is Machine Data With the rise of cheap storage and processing, we are in a better position to extract and process any type of data that can help with insights.
Any type of data produced by programs and processes is useful for us, we can use logs, network packets, any type of metrics and performance clues.
This means a large amount of unstructured data that is ready for our consumption and use.</description>

      <description> Linear Algrebra Matrix object This object is always two dimensional, and it doesn´t use the default broadcasting from ndarray.
We can create an identity matrix using np.eye:
identity = np.eye(3) identity Output: $ array([[ 1., 0., 0.], $ [ 0., 1., 0.], $ [ 0., 0., 1.]]) 
array([[ 1., 0., 0.], [ 0., 1., 0.], [ 0., 0., 1.]])
