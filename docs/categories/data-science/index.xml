      <description>Introduction The best way to learn a framework is to learn two at the same time and compare how things are being achieved in different ways, understanding the advantages and disadvantages.
Tensorflow and Pytorch are frameworks for fast tensor manipulation that is what is required for deep learning and some other machine learning methods.
Both heavily oriented towards machine learning and especially deep learning are low-level libraries to operate on tensors (n-dimensional arrays).</description>

      <description>Loss Functions The loss function calculates the difference between the output of your model and the &amp;ldquo;Ground Truth&amp;rdquo; or actual values.
There are multiple loss functions for regression and classification pourposes:
All this functiones measure the ratio between actual/reference and predicted, the differences are in how the outliersd impact the final outcome.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) Measures average/mean squared error of our predictions.
$$ MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum |yi - \hat{y}_i| $$ Gives less weight to the outliers, when you are sure that they are outliers prefer MAE to MSE.</description>

      <description>Introduction to Linear Regression  A linear regression tries to estimate a linear relationship that best fits a given set of data.
 We need to understand that Linear Regression won´t help us with non linear relationships.
When we do a regression we are trying to understand the strength and direction of the relationship between two or more variables.
This is different from correlation analysis, because the model allows us to infer on new inputs.</description>

      <description>Step 1. Install Hugo Goto hugo releases and download the appropriate version for your os and architecture.
Save it somewhere specific as we will be using it in the next step.
More complete instructions are available at installing hugo
Step 2. Build the Docs Hugo has its own example site which happens to also be the documentation site you are reading right now.
Follow the following steps:
 Clone the hugo repository Go into the repo Run hugo in server mode and build the docs Open your browser to http://localhost:1313  Corresponding pseudo commands:</description>

      <description>Move static content to static asdsdswd Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>So many new concepts for the beginner data scientist, let´s start one by one:
Tensor A tensor is a generalized matrix, it is defined by his rank, a rank zero tensor, is just a number, while a rank two tensor is a two dimensional matrix or array.
See: What’s the difference between a matrix and a tensor?
Features Terms for Simple Linear Regression  Response, dependent variable, Y-variable, target, outcome: This is the variable we are trying to predict.</description>
