      <description>Move static content to static asdsdswd Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <description>Hi!, I´m Daniel, originally from northern Spain and currently residing in Abu Dhabi.
I enjoy traveling. Each and every time, I find something magical about having a new stamp on my passport. Apart from experiencing the beauty of a new place, I enjoy the experience wherein I get to meet new people, learn about their culture and traditions, and thus expand my level of awareness to level higher.
Learning through travel changes you.</description>
